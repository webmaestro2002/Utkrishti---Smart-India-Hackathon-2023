Our team (Team Caffiene) developed CogniCare, a comprehensive solution for enhancing cognitive skills in children with disabilities through engaging cognitive games. Recognizing the lack of accessible, effective cognitive retraining programs for home use, we created Utkrishti, a user-friendly website that provides a one-stop solution for parents and caregivers. Our platform not only makes cognitive training enjoyable but also ensures it is accessible from the comfort of home, thereby addressing a critical gap in the support available for children with disabilities.
